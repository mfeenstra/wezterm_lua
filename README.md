Also compatible (most options) with Linux RHEL9 and Xwindows desktop managers.

Requires some modification for optimal UI/UX on Wayland.

## 1. Installation

It does (obviously) require WezTerm and some command line skills

__Install WezTerm (from iTerm), like so:__

```sh
brew install wezterm
```

## 2. Usage

__Copy `wezterm.lua` to your home folder, with a dot, and it will be auto-loaded:__

```sh
cp wezterm.lua $HOME/.wezterm.lua
```

That's all, folks!
